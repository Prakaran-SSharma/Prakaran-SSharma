📂 Featured Projects

🔹 Recruitment Finance Tracker – SQL Architecture  
A complete data system for managing candidate placements, agency billing, rate history, and compliance. Includes normalized schema, analytical views, and stored procedures.  

🎯 My Goal  
🚀 To turn messy spreadsheets into clean dashboards, tangled data into SQL elegance, and recruiter chaos into calm, clickable insights.  

📊 Short-term: Build a recruitment finance dashboard so intuitive, even a recruiter on Monday morning can use it without coffee ☕.  

🧠 Long-term: Lead data strategy that makes stakeholders say, “Wait… this came from Excel?”  
💡 I build systems that don’t just crunch numbers—they tell stories, spark decisions, and occasionally make people smile 😄.  

📌 Motto: *“If it’s in Excel, I can automate it. If it’s in SQL, I can scale it.”*
